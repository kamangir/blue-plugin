1. [blue-rvr](https://github.com/kamangir/blue-rvr): A low-cost rover that carries a camera, runs deep learning vision models through python and TensorFlow, and is cloud-connected.
1. [blue-sbc](https://github.com/kamangir/blue-sbc): python + bash bootstrap for single board computers: Raspberry Pi & Jetson Nano.
1. [browser](https://github.com/kamangir/browser): A browser for cloud objects with metadata.

## If you already have a repo

To build an `abcli` plugin you need code that is executed through the command line. This code should exist in a repo, i.e. `<plugin-name>`. Now, follow these steps:

1. Make sure that you have an up-to-date copy of `abcli` running on a dev machine.
1. Checkout the repo `<plugin-name>`.
1. Run `abcli plugin make <plugin-name>`.
1. Run `abcli init` and validate that `<plugin-name>` is loaded.
1. Commit and push the changes to the repo `<plugin-name>` and start developing... ðŸš€
